    <h1>Tacos</h1>
    <p>Flautas are also known as rolled tacos. 
        These tasty chicken flautas are the best. 
        I learned how to 
        make them, and my husband loved them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped black olives</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>toothpicks</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium 
                heat; stir in flour until smooth. 
                Add onion; cook and stir until onion is 
                softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add black olives, 
                lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil, paprika, black pepper, 
                and salt; cook and stir until heated through, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken; remove the skillet from heat and cover.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan or deep fryer over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Fill tortillas with chicken mixture. Roll tortilla around filling and 
                secure with a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry rolled tortillas in hot 
                oil until browned, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted 
                spoon or tongs to transfer tortillas 
                to a paper towel-lined plate; serve warm.</li>
