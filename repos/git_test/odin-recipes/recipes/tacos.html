        <h1>Tacos</h1>
        <p>The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered 
            with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard 
            shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground 
            beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, 
            sour cream and fresh guacamole. You can top it with 
            whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Also, 
            if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft 
            shell, and the refried beans in the hard.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, 
                and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning
                over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking
                it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and
                crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small 
                saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning 
                packet. Heat the refried beans over low heat until 
                simmering.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). 
                Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and 
                warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados 
                in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, 
                the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste, 
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with 
                about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. 
                Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla 
                shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef 
                along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle 
                about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on 
                top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded 
                lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, 
                and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
